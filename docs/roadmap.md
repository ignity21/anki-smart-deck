# Roadmap

## Future major version: deployable web service

Explore evolving ankinote from a local CLI/NiceGUI application into a web
service that can be deployed to the public internet.

The web version must include user identity and access management as a
foundational concern, rather than an afterthought. Initial planning should
cover:

- user registration, sign-in, sign-out, and secure session management;
- account recovery and verification flows;
- authorization and strict per-user data isolation;
- secure storage and handling of user-provided AI-provider credentials, if
  supported;
- deployment, HTTPS, secrets management, observability, and abuse/rate-limit
  controls;
- how web users create and synchronize cards with Anki, without assuming a
  publicly reachable AnkiConnect instance.

Status: idea only; not scheduled and not a commitment to a specific framework
or authentication provider.
