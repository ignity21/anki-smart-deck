# Roadmap

Unscheduled product directions. Nothing here is a commitment to a date,
framework, or API.

## STEM architecture (shipped)

The unified STEM schema has been replaced by four independent generation models,
prompts, field sets, and Anki note types:

- `AINote STEM Concept`: front, brief answer, detailed explanation, image.
- `AINote STEM Formula`: front, formula, meaning, variables, conditions, derivation, image.
- `AINote STEM Procedure`: front, summary, steps, conditions, image.
- `AINote STEM Example`: front, answer, solution steps, explanation, image.

All use `front` as the first field (Anki's default sort field), native Anki
tags, and the shared `AINote::STEM` deck and paper-card visual theme.
Structured variable/step lists render into their own storage fields.
There is no stored `card_type` field and no V2 suffix.

The common STEM entrypoint accepts automatic classification or an explicit type.
Automatic mode classifies first and then loads the selected type's prompt/schema;
explicit selection skips classification. All four GUI flows offer editable
previews before saving. Reference-image input and optional generated diagrams
remain available. Upserts are scoped by note type as well as front and deck.

The legacy `AINote STEM` is no longer created or updated. Existing legacy notes
are left alone; there is no automatic migration or deletion.

## Comparison card type (next)

Add `AINote STEM Comparison` with its own model, prompt, field set, and templates.
Contrast pairs such as L1 vs L2 regularization, bias vs variance, or TCP vs UDP.

- Structured `items` (name + definition) and `aspects` (aspect + per-item values).
- Render an aspect-by-aspect table, stacking vertically on narrow screens.
- Register the type in classification, CLI selection, and GUI management/preview.
- Reuse shared styling with `--badge-comparison-*` tokens.

## Progressive disclosure and rendering polish

- Allow detailed explanations/derivations to expand on demand. Verify
  `<details>` on Anki desktop and AnkiDroid before shipping; keep a visible
  fallback where unsupported.
- Shared MathJax macro configuration for common notation.
- Optional `common_mistakes` callout where appropriate, added to the relevant
  type's schema and template rather than a new card type.

Comparison is the next feature; rendering polish can be delivered independently.

## Thinking control (shipped; follow-ups)

`TextGenerationService.generate_text` now takes `reasoning_effort`. The language
generators (`word`, `phrase`, `sentence`) pass `DISABLE_REASONING`, which the
service turns into DeepSeek's OpenAI-format `extra_body={"thinking": {"type":
"disabled"}}` (DeepSeek enables thinking by default and its LiteLLM routing
discards a plain `reasoning_effort`). `stem` keeps thinking on.

All CLI commands now take `--thinking [off|low|medium|high|default]` to override
the per-collection default for a single run. `services.ai.resolve_thinking`
(with `THINKING_CHOICES`) maps the choice to a `reasoning_effort` value; it is
shared by the CLI (`cli/factory` re-exports it) and the STEM generation page in
the GUI, which exposes the same five levels as a dropdown.

Open items:

- DeepSeek ignores `temperature` while thinking is on, so `stem`'s
  `temperature=0.3` is currently a no-op. Decide whether `stem` should also
  disable thinking (regaining temperature control) or drop the unused argument.
- The `extra_body` thinking field is DeepSeek-specific. If another text
  provider is adopted, translate `DISABLE_REASONING` per provider instead.
- Disabling thinking made the model less consistent about the output contract
  (`word` occasionally returns a bare record instead of a JSON array; now
  tolerated in `generate_word_data`). Watch for similar contract slips in the
  other language generators and tighten prompts or parsing as needed.

Status: minor follow-ups; not scheduled.

## Future major version: deployable web service

Explore evolving ankinote from a local CLI/NiceGUI application into a web
service that can be deployed to the public internet.

The web version must include user identity and access management as a
foundational concern, rather than an afterthought. Initial planning should
cover:

- user registration, sign-in, sign-out, and secure session management;
- account recovery and verification flows;
- authorization and strict per-user data isolation;
- secure storage and handling of user-provided AI-provider credentials, if
  supported;
- deployment, HTTPS, secrets management, observability, and abuse/rate-limit
  controls;
- how web users create and synchronize cards with Anki, without assuming a
  publicly reachable AnkiConnect instance.

Status: idea only; not scheduled and not a commitment to a specific framework
or authentication provider.
